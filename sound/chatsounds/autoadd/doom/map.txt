you think the only way is to kill them all leave nothing behind and you may be right;you think the only way is to kill them all leave nothing behind and you may be right but we cant just shut it all down without argent energy it will be worse i dont expect you to agree

what you are destroying is more valuable than you can possibly imagine;what you are destroying is more valuable than you can possibly imagine it is a perfect and unlimited energy resource

do not be alarmed by the system update;do not be alarmed by the system update it is a prototype of our interdimensional tether a means to pull you back from hell im sorry for the jolt but i didnt think youd allow its installation voluntarily

if stopping our energy production is what you want;if stopping our energy production is what you want then you need only to destroy this last filter and argent energy will no longer exist in this solar system we will be back at square one
